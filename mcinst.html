     <p> Please read the following statement carefully and  consider its implications. Afterward, you will be asked to briefly describe the main points. </p>
     <p><em>Many sociologists, psychologists,  economists, and political scientists agree that improving relations  between people of different ethnicities should be a vital priority for  the </em><em>United States. We are in the unique position of having  many different cultural groups living within our borders. This could  potentially be a great asset because different cultural groups bring  different perspectives to life, providing a richness in styles of  interaction, problem solving strategies, food, dress, music, and art.  Each ethnic group within the United States can contribute in its own  unique way. Recognizing this diversity would help to build a sense of  harmony and complementarity among the various ethnic groups. Each group  has its own talents, as well as its own problems, and by acknowledging  both these strengths and weaknesses, we validate the identity of each  group and we recognize its existence and its importance to the social  fabric. We can allow each group to utilize its assets, to be aware of  its own particular problems or difficulties, and overall to live up to  its potential. </em></p>
     <p><em>Understanding both the similarities and  differences among ethnic groups is an essential component of long-term  social harmony in the United States, and recognizing the unique social  characteristics of each cultural or ethnic group will lead to smoother  interactions between people. </em></p>
